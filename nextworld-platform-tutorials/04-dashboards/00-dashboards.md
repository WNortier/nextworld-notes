When you log in to Nextworld, you go to the Nextworld Dashboard, which is comprised of dashboard pages. Dashboard pages provide a way to display information overviews, summaries, and reports. Dashboard pages are fully customizable, and can be shared across users. Like most objects in Nextworld, dashboard cards use information that is custom.

You can use dashboard cards to create configurations of information. Dashboard cards can display information from an application, in a different format. There are many types of dashboard cards, including:

- Date Countdown
- Mini Application
- Notifications

You add dashboard cards to dashboard pages, which a user can open and flip through. You can configure the layout and appearance of cards on the page. This means that you can organize areas of information into pages. For example, a company could have one financial dashboard page that contains payables information such as invoices, contact history, contact notes, and payment details. The company could have another financials dashboard page that contains receivables information such as cash receipt details, invoices, and accounts receivable aging.

Information displayed on dashboard cards is generated when the dashboard is opened, which means it is always up-to-date.
